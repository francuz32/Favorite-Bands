                    With the sole idea of practicing HTML and CSS, I've decided to make a list of my favorite bands.
                    I'll only
                    include some information, pictures, and links to their official websites. The information I'll use
                    will be
                    taken from Wikipedia, just to make it faster and focus on the design of the page, even thought it'll
                    be simple.
                    For each band, I'll be including a small list of my favorite songs by each of them. These songs
                    won't be in any particular order.

                <p>Kiss is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973 by Paul Stanley,
                    Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss. Known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the
                    group rose to prominence in the mid-1970s with shocking live performances, which featured
                    fire-breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and
                    pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several line-up changes, with Stanley and Simmons the only
                    consistent members. The original and best-known line-up consisted of Stanley (vocals and rhythm
                    guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass), Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Criss (drums and vocals).

                    With their make-up and costumes, the band members took on the personae of comic book-style
                    characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and
                    the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, Criss departed the band in 1980 and Frehley in
                    1982, though both would return later.

                    In 1983, Kiss began performing without make-up and costumes, marking the beginning of the band's
                    "unmasked" era that would last for over a decade. The band experienced a commercial resurgence
                    during this era, with the Platinum-certified album Lick It Up successfully introducing them to a new
                    generation of fans, and its music videos receiving regular airplay on MTV. Eric Carr, who had
                    replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to
                    a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original line-up reunited in 1996, which also saw the
                    return of its make-up and stage costumes. The resulting reunion tour was highly successful, grossing
                    $143.7 million, making it the band's most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley subsequently
                    left the band again, and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band has
                    continued with its original stage make-up, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and
                    Spaceman make-up, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording
                    and performing, it would embark on its final tour, the End of the Road World Tour, which started in
                    January 2019 and is currently set to conclude in 2023.

                <p>System of a Down (also known as SoaD or simply System) is an Armenian-American heavy metal band
                    formed in Glendale, California, in 1994. Since 1997, the band has consisted of Serj Tankian (lead
                    vocals, keyboards); Daron Malakian (guitar, vocals); Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals); and John
                    Dolmayan (drums), who replaced original drummer Andy Khachaturian.

                    The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted
                    at number one on the US Billboard 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards
                    and their song "B.Y.O.B." won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2006. The band went
                    on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010. Other than two new songs in 2020 ("Protect the Land" and
                    "Genocidal Humanoidz"), System of a Down has not released a full-length record since the
                    Mezmerize and Hypnotize albums in 2005. The band has sold over 12 million records worldwide, while
                    two of their singles "Aerials" and "Hypnotize" reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs
                    chart.

                    All members of System of a Down are of Armenian descent, being born to Armenian immigrants or being
                    immigrants themselves.

                    With the sole idea of practicing HTML and CSS, I've decided to make a list of my favorite bands.
                    I'll only
                    include some information, pictures, and links to their official websites. The information I'll use
                    will be
                    taken from Wikipedia, just to make it faster and focus on the design of the page, even thought it'll
                    be simple.
                    For each band, I'll be including a small list of my favorite songs by each of them. These songs
                    won't be in any particular order.

                <p>Kiss is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973 by Paul Stanley,
                    Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss. Known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the
                    group rose to prominence in the mid-1970s with shocking live performances, which featured
                    fire-breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and
                    pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several line-up changes, with Stanley and Simmons the only
                    consistent members. The original and best-known line-up consisted of Stanley (vocals and rhythm
                    guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass), Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Criss (drums and vocals).

                    With their make-up and costumes, the band members took on the personae of comic book-style
                    characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and
                    the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, Criss departed the band in 1980 and Frehley in
                    1982, though both would return later.

                    In 1983, Kiss began performing without make-up and costumes, marking the beginning of the band's
                    "unmasked" era that would last for over a decade. The band experienced a commercial resurgence
                    during this era, with the Platinum-certified album Lick It Up successfully introducing them to a new
                    generation of fans, and its music videos receiving regular airplay on MTV. Eric Carr, who had
                    replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to
                    a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original line-up reunited in 1996, which also saw the
                    return of its make-up and stage costumes. The resulting reunion tour was highly successful, grossing
                    $143.7 million, making it the band's most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley subsequently
                    left the band again, and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band has
                    continued with its original stage make-up, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and
                    Spaceman make-up, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording
                    and performing, it would embark on its final tour, the End of the Road World Tour, which started in
                    January 2019 and is currently set to conclude in 2023.

                <p>System of a Down (also known as SoaD or simply System) is an Armenian-American heavy metal band
                    formed in Glendale, California, in 1994. Since 1997, the band has consisted of Serj Tankian (lead
                    vocals, keyboards); Daron Malakian (guitar, vocals); Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals); and John
                    Dolmayan (drums), who replaced original drummer Andy Khachaturian.

                    The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted
                    at number one on the US Billboard 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards
                    and their song "B.Y.O.B." won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2006. The band went
                    on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010. Other than two new songs in 2020 ("Protect the Land" and
                    "Genocidal Humanoidz"), System of a Down has not released a full-length record since the
                    Mezmerize and Hypnotize albums in 2005. The band has sold over 12 million records worldwide, while
                    two of their singles "Aerials" and "Hypnotize" reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs
                    chart.

                    All members of System of a Down are of Armenian descent, being born to Armenian immigrants or being
                    immigrants themselves.

                <p>Whitesnake are an English hard rock band formed in London in 1978. The group was originally put
                    together as the backing band for singer David Coverdale, who had recently left Deep Purple. Though
                    the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout
                    their history.

                    Whitesnake enjoyed much success in the UK, Europe and Japan through their early years. Their albums
                    Ready an' Willing, Come an' Get It and Saints & Sinners all reached the top ten on the UK Albums
                    Chart. By the mid-1980s, however, Coverdale had set his sights on breaking through in North America,
                    where Whitesnake remained largely unknown. With the backing of American label Geffen Records,
                    Whitesnake released their eponymous album in 1987, which became their biggest success to date,
                    selling over eight million copies in the US and spawning the hit singles "Here I Go Again" and "Is
                    This Love". Whitesnake also adopted a more contemporary look, akin to the Los Angeles glam metal
                    scene. After releasing Slip of the Tongue in 1989, Coverdale decided to put Whitesnake on hold to
                    take a break from the music industry. Aside from a few short-lived reunions in the 1990s, Whitesnake
                    remained mostly inactive until 2003, when Coverdale put together a new line-up to celebrate the
                    band's 25th anniversary. Since then Whitesnake have released four more studio albums and toured
                    extensively around the world.

                    Whitesnake's early sound has been characterized by critics as blues rock, but by the mid-1980s the
                    band slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible hard rock style. Topics such as love
                    and sex are common in Whitesnake's lyrics, which have been criticized for their excessive use of
                    sexual innuendos and double entendres. Whitesnake have been nominated for several awards during
                    their career, including Best British Group at the 1988 Brit Awards. They have also been featured on
                    lists of the greatest hard rock bands of all time by several media outlets, while their songs
                    and albums have appeared on many "best of" lists by outlets, such as VH1 and Rolling Stone.

                <p>Toto (stylized as TOTO) is an American rock band formed in 1977 in Los Angeles. The band's current
                    lineup consists of Steve Lukather (guitars and vocals), David Paich (keyboards and vocals), and
                    Joseph Williams (vocals), as well as touring musicians John Pierce (bass), Robert "Sput" Searight
                    (drums), Dominique "Xavier" Taplin (keyboards and vocals), Steve Maggiora (keyboards and vocals),
                    and Warren Ham (horns and vocals). Toto is known for a musical style that combines elements of pop,
                    rock, soul, funk, progressive rock, hard rock, R&B, blues, and jazz. Having released 14 studio
                    albums and sold over 40 million records worldwide, the group has received several Grammy Awards
                    and was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009.

                    David Paich and Jeff Porcaro had played together as session musicians on several albums and decided
                    to form a band; David Hungate, Steve Lukather, Steve Porcaro, and Bobby Kimball were recruited
                    before the release of the band's eponymous debut album in 1978. Led by the Top 5 single "Hold the
                    Line", the album brought the band to mainstream attention but it was their fourth album Toto IV
                    (1982) which brought them global attention. "Africa" topped the Billboard Hot 100, while "Rosanna"
                    reached number 2, helping Toto become one of the best-selling music groups of their era. The makeup
                    of the group continued to evolve: Kimball left in 1984 then rejoined in 1998, leaving again a decade
                    later; Jeff Porcaro died in 1992; Hungate, having left in 1982, rejoined Toto as a touring musician
                    and later a bandmember; in 2008, Lukather announced his departure from the band and the remaining
                    band members later went their separate ways.

                    In the summer of 2010, Toto reformed and went on a short European tour, with a new lineup, to
                    benefit Mike Porcaro, who had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and was no
                    longer an active member. He died in 2015. The band celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2017 with a
                    supporting tour before going inactive once again in 2019. In October 2020, the band announced that
                    guitarist and founding member Steve Lukather and longtime vocalist Joseph Williams would return to
                    touring as Toto (with a mostly new lineup) in the 2021 "Dogz of Oz" tour and in a live-streamed
                    concert on November 21, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
